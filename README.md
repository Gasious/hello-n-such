Fulfilling the need to create
I feel the need to develop programming skills, but always hit a wall 
Rightnow my typed text isn't even showing
The creative energy always dissipates in a fight to get me to the path someone else has chosen, so there you go, I can't read what I'm typing and it will not serve any purpose
